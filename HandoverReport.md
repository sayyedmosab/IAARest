Handover Report: IbnExp2 Meal Subscription App
Project Overview
Title: IbnExp2 - Meal Subscription App
Purpose: A full-stack web application for Academia members to subscribe to healthy meal plans, featuring user registration, plan selection, admin management, and bilingual support (English/Arabic).
Target Users: Academia students and staff seeking convenient, healthy meal subscriptions.
Technical Stack: Angular (frontend), Node.js with Express and TypeScript (backend), SQLite database, Vite dev server, Tailwind CSS.

Core Features
User registration and authentication
Meal plan subscription system
Admin panel for meal management, scheduling, and order oversight
Bilingual meal descriptions and UI (English/Arabic)
Image gallery for meals with proper path handling
Responsive design for web access
Current Project Status
Overall Progress: ~70% complete (estimated based on implemented features vs. planned scope)
Current Phase: Debugging and stabilization - fixing image display issues and compilation errors
Architecture: RESTful API backend serving Angular SPA frontend, with SQLite for data persistence.

Major Milestones
‚úÖ Project initialization and tech stack setup
‚úÖ Backend API development (meals, users, plans routes)
‚úÖ Frontend component development (auth, home, admin panels)
‚úÖ Database schema and data relationships
üîÑ Image handling fixes (in progress)
‚è≥ Full app testing and deployment preparation
Component Breakdown
Backend (Node.js/Express): API routes implemented, static file serving working, debug logging added
Frontend (Angular): Core components built, routing configured, image pipe implemented
Database (SQLite): Schema defined, data seeding completed
DevOps: Docker setup, proxy configuration for local development
Challenges Faced
Image Path Inconsistencies: DB stores image_filename with potential leading slashes, frontend expected imageUrl field. Resolved by normalizing API responses and adding client-side pipe for path computation.
Runtime vs. Source Code Sync: Running server uses compiled dist files, requiring mirrored edits to ensure changes take effect.
TypeScript Compilation Errors: Recent edits introduced type mismatches, requiring fixes to models and templates.
Endpoint Debugging: Ingredients endpoint returning 404, added tracing middleware to investigate.
Relative vs. Absolute Paths: User preference for relative image paths may cause issues on nested routes.
Current Problems & Hypotheses
Active Issues
TypeScript Errors: tsc exits with code 1; likely due to model type mismatches or leftover imageUrl references.
Image Display Failures: Some templates still reference removed imageUrl, preventing image requests.
Ingredients Endpoint: Frontend shows 404 for /api/ingredients; may be missing route or misconfigured.
Pursued Hypotheses
Template Patches Hypothesis: Replacing remaining imageUrl bindings with image_filename | imagePath will restore image loading and trigger debug logs for verification.
Type Check Resolution Hypothesis: Fixing tsc errors (likely in models or pipe imports) will ensure clean compilation and prevent runtime issues.
Ingredients Route Hypothesis: Adding or restoring the /api/ingredients endpoint will resolve the 404 and enable ingredient display in meal details.
Next Priorities
Complete template patches for image bindings
Run and fix TypeScript compilation errors
Investigate and implement ingredients endpoint
Browser testing for image loading and full functionality
Final deployment preparation
Blockers
TypeScript compilation failures preventing build validation
Potential missing backend routes for ingredients data
Key Decisions Made
Preserve DB image_filename as canonical to avoid destructive changes
Use presentation-layer helpers (ImagePathPipe) for final URL construction
Maintain bilingual support with localized fields in API responses
Add debug logging for troubleshooting image paths and API calls
Architectural Patterns
REST API Architecture: Controllers handle requests, services manage business logic, repositories abstract data access
Component-Based Frontend: Angular standalone components with reactive forms and routing
MVC Backend: Routes/Controllers/Services separation for maintainability
Handover Notes
Memory Bank files have been updated with current project state
Debug logs are active: Check server stdout for [MEALS DEBUG] and client console for [IMAGE PIPE]
Running servers: Backend on port 4000, frontend dev on 4200 with proxy
Key files: meals.ts, image-path.pipe.ts, component templates under components
This handover provides a complete project snapshot for continued development. All context is preserved in the Memory Bank for seamless continuation.
