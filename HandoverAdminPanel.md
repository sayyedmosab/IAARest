  Handover Report: Ibnexp2 Project

  Project: ibnexp2
  Location: /home/mosab/projects/ibnexp2/
  Objective: A full-stack meal subscription management application.

  1. Project Architecture Summary

   * Frontend: An Angular 20 application located in /home/mosab/projects/ibnexp2/. It serves the user interface and admin panel.
       * Port: 4200
       * Key Technologies: TypeScript, RxJS, Tailwind CSS (via CDN).
   * Backend: A Node.js/Express API server located in /home/mosab/projects/ibnexp2/backend/. It handles business logic, data processing, and
     database interactions.
       * Port: 4000
       * Key Technologies: TypeScript, Express.js, SQLite, JWT for authentication.
   * Database: A SQLite database with the schema defined in
     /home/mosab/projects/ibnexp2/backend/src/database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql.

  2. Key Challenges & Resolutions

  This project was assembled from what appears to be at least two different codebases, resulting in significant configuration and runtime
  conflicts. The following major challenges were identified and resolved:

   * Backend Compilation Failures:
       * Problem: The backend had numerous TypeScript errors (TS18046, TS2835, etc.) due to a mismatch between the ES Module setting in
         package.json ("type": "module") and the CommonJS-style code.
       * Resolution: Systematically corrected all relative import paths in the backend source code to include the .js extension, satisfying
         the ES Module requirement.

   * Angular Frontend Startup Failures:
       * Problem: The Angular project was misconfigured with a React entry point (index.tsx) in angular.json, causing the ng serve command to
         fail. It also suffered from persistent, misleading "Port in use" errors due to the CLI's interactive nature.
       * Resolution:
           1. A proper src/main.ts was created to bootstrap the Angular application.
           2. angular.json was corrected to point to src/main.ts as the entry point.
           3. The conflicting index.tsx file was removed.
           4. The "Port in use" issue was bypassed by forcefully terminating lingering ng processes.

   * Asset (Image) Serving Failures:
       * Problem: Images were not appearing due to a combination of incorrect file paths, CORS-like errors
         (net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE.NotSameOrigin), and misconfiguration of how assets were served.
       * Resolution: The strategy was clarified to serve all images from the frontend. This involved:
           1. Ensuring angular.json was correctly configured to serve the src/assets directory.
           2. Adding <base href="/"> to index.html for correct routing.
           3. Correcting hardcoded image paths in the HTML templates to point to the /images/ directory, as per your final instruction.

  3. Current Problem & Active Hypothesis

   * Problem: The Admin Panel's "Daily Orders" page is not functional. It displays incorrect data because the frontend is performing complex
     calculations based on flawed assumptions, and the backend API endpoint that should provide this data is not being used and is itself
     incomplete.

   * Active Hypothesis: The most robust and performant solution is to move the complex data aggregation logic to the backend. The backend has
     direct, efficient access to the database and should be responsible for calculating the daily preparation lists. The frontend should be
     simplified to only display the final, aggregated data it receives from the API.

  4. Next Steps (Pending Confirmation)

  The immediate goal is to fix the "Daily Orders" feature by implementing the active hypothesis.

   1. Import `meal_ingredients` Data: You have this data in a CSV file. The recommended path is for you to convert it to a JSON array, after
      which I can guide you through using the existing backend data importer script (/utils/import-data.ts) to populate the database.
   2. Implement Backend Logic: Once the ingredient data is in place, I will propose the specific code changes to:
       * Create a new, powerful SQL query in the SubscriptionRepository to correctly calculate daily meal counts.
       * Update the /admin/daily-orders endpoint to use this new method and perform the final ingredient aggregation.
   3. Refactor Frontend Component: After the backend is providing the correct data structure, I will propose changes to the
      DailyOrdersComponent to remove its local calculations and instead fetch and display the data from the corrected API endpoint.
