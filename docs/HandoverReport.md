Component Breakdown
Backend (Node.js/Express): API routes implemented, subscription state service added, static file serving working, debug logging added
Frontend (Angular): Core components built, routing configured, image pipe implemented, subscription management components added
Database (SQLite): Enhanced schema with subscription state history, data migration completed
DevOps: Docker setup, proxy configuration for local development
Challenges Faced
Image Path Inconsistencies: DB stores image_filename with potential leading slashes, frontend expected imageUrl field. Resolved by normalizing API responses and adding client-side pipe for path computation.
Runtime vs. Source Code Sync: Running server uses compiled dist files, requiring mirrored edits to ensure changes take effect.
TypeScript Compilation Errors: Recent edits introduced type mismatches, requiring fixes to models and templates.
Endpoint Debugging: Ingredients endpoint returning 404, added tracing middleware to investigate.
Relative vs. Absolute Paths: User preference for relative image paths may cause issues on nested routes.
Current Problems & Hypotheses
Active Issues
TypeScript Errors: tsc exits with code 1; likely due to model type mismatches or leftover imageUrl references.
Image Display Failures: Some templates still reference removed imageUrl, preventing image requests.
Ingredients Endpoint: Frontend shows 404 for /api/ingredients; may be missing route or misconfigured.
Pursued Hypotheses
Template Patches Hypothesis: Replacing remaining imageUrl bindings with image_filename | imagePath will restore image loading and trigger debug logs for verification.
Type Check Resolution Hypothesis: Fixing tsc errors (likely in models or pipe imports) will ensure clean compilation and prevent runtime issues.
Ingredients Route Hypothesis: Adding or restoring the /api/ingredients endpoint will resolve the 404 and enable ingredient display in meal details.
Next Priorities
Complete template patches for image bindings
Run and fix TypeScript compilation errors
Investigate and implement ingredients endpoint
Browser testing for image loading and full functionality
Final deployment preparation
Blockers
TypeScript compilation failures preventing build validation
Potential missing backend routes for ingredients data
Key Decisions Made
Preserve DB image_filename as canonical to avoid destructive changes
Use presentation-layer helpers (ImagePathPipe) for final URL construction
Maintain bilingual support with localized fields in API responses
Add debug logging for troubleshooting image paths and API calls
Architectural Patterns
REST API Architecture: Controllers handle requests, services manage business logic, repositories abstract data access
Component-Based Frontend: Angular standalone components with reactive forms and routing
MVC Backend: Routes/Controllers/Services separation for maintainability
Handover Notes
Memory Bank files have been updated with current project state
Debug logs are active: Check server stdout for [MEALS DEBUG] and client console for [IMAGE PIPE]
Running servers: Backend on port 4000, frontend dev on 4200 with proxy
Key files: meals.ts, image-path.pipe.ts, component templates under components

## Enhanced Subscription Model Implementation

### Overview
The subscription system has been significantly enhanced with a comprehensive state management model that captures the complete customer lifecycle. The new implementation provides better business intelligence, improved user experience, and enhanced administrative controls.

### New Subscription States
1. **Pending_Approval**: For manual payment methods requiring admin approval
2. **Curious**: Trial users with single-cycle subscriptions and no auto-renewal
3. **New_Joiner**: New customers with auto-renewal who become Active after 2 successful cycles
4. **Active**: Established customers with successful payment history
5. **Frozen**: Temporarily suspended accounts (no deliveries or payments)
6. **Exiting**: Customers in their final paid cycle after cancellation
7. **Cancelled**: Fully terminated subscriptions with no activity

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Schema**: Enhanced subscriptions table with new columns for payment_method, auto_renewal, completed_cycles, and notes
- **State History**: Complete audit trail with subscription_state_history table
- **State Service**: SubscriptionStateService handles all transitions with business rule validation
- **API Endpoints**: New routes for state transitions, history tracking, and bulk operations
- **Frontend Components**: Enhanced user management interface with state transition controls

### State Transition Rules
- All transitions are validated against business rules
- Automatic transitions (New_Joiner ‚Üí Active after 2 cycles)
- Admin-controlled transitions (Pending_Approval ‚Üí Active)
- User-initiated transitions (Active ‚Üí Frozen, Active ‚Üí Exiting)
- Terminal states (Cancelled, Expired)

### Migration Strategy
- Existing data preserved through careful migration scripts
- Historical state changes tracked in new history table
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition

## Recent Enhancements

### Subscription Management Features
- **State-based Dashboard**: Real-time metrics for all subscription states
- **Bulk Operations**: Admin can transition multiple subscriptions simultaneously
- **State History Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all subscription changes
- **Automated Processing**: System handles New_Joiner activation and Exiting cancellations
- **Payment Integration**: Support for credit card and manual payment methods

### User Interface Improvements
- **Enhanced User Management**: Display subscription status directly in user listings
- **State Transition Modals**: Intuitive interface for changing subscription states
- **Approval Workflow**: Streamlined process for Pending_Approval subscriptions
- **History Visualization**: Timeline view of subscription state changes

### API Enhancements
- **State Transition Endpoint**: `POST /subscriptions/:id/transition`
- **State History Endpoint**: `GET /subscriptions/:id/history`
- **Bulk Operations**: Support for multiple subscription state changes
- **Automated Processing**: `POST /subscriptions/admin/process-transitions`
